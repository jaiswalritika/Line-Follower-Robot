Every team member contributed equally while building the line-following robot. We regularly held meetings to plan and refine the calculation of PID values,
adjust motor velocities in different states, and ultimately finalize the implementation. We encountered issues such as incorrect robot movement and unexpected 
stops while following the line. However, through consistent testing and discussions in our meetings, we successfully resolved these challenges.
