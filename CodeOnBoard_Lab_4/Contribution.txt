Ritika and Jayesh worked on Blacklineswitching logic and blackline following, along with the counter node.
They worked on nodedetection, BlackForward, BlackStop, BlackLeft, BlackRight, BlackDriftLeft, BlackDriftRight, and worked out on the logic for our bot to turn right on both the first two nodes detected, and turn left on the third node and then to stop on the forth node detected. 

Atul and Utkarsh worked together on the obstacle detection and avoidance logic. They wrote ObstacleAvoidance, RightTurn1, Move1, Forward1, Move2, LeftTurn1, Move3, Forward2, Move4, LeftTurn2, Move5 and RightTurn3 states and worked on the logic for our bot to detect obstacle and take the first right turn, move forward until the left sensor keeps detecting the object, then take a left turn , then again move forward until the left sensor keeps detecting the object, then again take a left turn, and then again move forward until the left sensor keeps detecting the object, then follow the Black line again.
